# NodeJS_Sample
This is a sample project of some of my NodeJS code.
What you can to expect to see:
  * Regular additions to this project,
  * Improvement throughout the project over time. The improved code I will probably keep in the original file and then only comment out the old code. I will add the tag ***OLD_CODE*** to the comments header for you to know why its not deleted.
  * You can expect that the code might change direction fairly often. As this is not a project for a spesific client, I will be using this to store and explore skills that I have learnt in my working environment.
  
What is NodeJS_Sample:
  This is my take to a demo of my skills. I will also at a later stage add a full on project hopefully with a front-end that will be a good demo project for people who either need some practice and also for people to see what skills I have.
  
  
  
This project is basic API that runs all the requests and end points from the server.js. At my current level I am not sure if I should change the locaiton of the endpoints. 
This will then take the request and call the needed function. It will output it to a basic output  that you can find by navigating to the port 8989.

Check the Settings file for the configuration of the project.

You can run this project but downloading it and then navigate into the dir and run:
  "node app.js"
